## Background
I learned some C when I took CS50x, but C wasn't a language I wanted to learn. C had difficult syntax, which was hard for me. CS50x had introduced Python, so I decided to learn Python instead. I am relearning C because, to simply put it, Python sucks. Python is a very slow langauge, and C is a good language to learn.

## What I Learned
- `scanf` is the C equivalent of Python's `input` function.
- `printf` is the C equivalent of Python's `print` function.
- `%s` is the C equivalent of putting an `f` before a string in Python and using `{}`.
- `%d` is the C equivalent of putting an `f` before a number in Python and using `{}`.
- `argc` is the number of arguments passed to the program.
- `argv` is an array of strings containing the arguments passed to the program.
- `#include` is the C equivalent of Python's `import` statement.
- C is statically typed.
- C is compiled, not interpreted like Python.
- `fopen` is the C equivalent of Python's `open` function.
- `fclose` is the C equivalent of Python's `close` function.
- `fgets` is the C equivalent of Python's `readline` function.
- `FILE*` is the C equivalent of Python's file object.
- `strcat` is the C equivalent of Python's `+` operator to concatenate strings.
- `strlen` is the C equivalent of Python's `len` function.
- `strcmp` is the C equivalent of Python's `==` operator to compare strings.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/zanderlewis/c-examples.git`
2. Change the directory. `cd c-examples`
3. Compile the program. `gcc -o hello examples/hello.c`
4. Run the program. `./hello`
