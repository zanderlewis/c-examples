# c-examples
Small C projects I made while relearning C.

## What I Learned
- `scanf` is the C equivalent of Python's `input` function.
- `printf` is the C equivalent of Python's `print` function.
- `%s` is the C equivalent of putting an `f` before a string in Python and using `{}`.
- `%d` is the C equivalent of putting an `f` before a number in Python and using `{}`.
- `argc` is the number of arguments passed to the program.
- `argv` is an array of strings containing the arguments passed to the program.
- `#include` is the C equivalent of Python's `import` statement.
- C is statically typed.
- C is compiled, not interpreted like Python.
